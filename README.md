### 🧠 Science meets Art.

I am **George (Kuo-Wei) Kao**, a **Ph.D. in Systems Neuroscience** and an **Award-Winning Underwater Artist**.

I don't just take photos; I construct them using **computational neuroscience** and **custom AI algorithms**. By building my own tools, I capture the ocean's hidden patterns that standard equipment cannot see.

#### 🚀 The Tech Behind The Art
I leverage Python and Generative AI to revolutionize the creative workflow:
- **🤖 AI Art Automation:** Custom bots that transform raw underwater data into artistic expressions.
- **⚡ Computational Imaging:** Algorithms for advanced image slicing and panoramic reconstruction.
- **🌊 Ecological Data:** Applying scientific observation methods to capture rare marine behavior.

#### 🏆 Distinction
Recognized as **Taiwan's highest-educated underwater photographer**, bringing a doctoral-level rigorous approach to ocean art.
